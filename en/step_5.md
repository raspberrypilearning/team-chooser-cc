## Challenge: Choosing for team B
Can you add code to choose a player at random for team B? You'll need to:

+ Create a new `teamB` list
+ Choose a random player for team B (called `playerB`)
+ `append` the chosen player to your `teamB` list
+ `remove` the chosen player from your list of `players`

The code you'll need for `teamB` will be __very__ similar to the code you've already written for `teamA`!
