## Players

Let's start by creating a list of players to choose from.



+ Open the blank Python template Trinket: <a href="http://jumpto.cc/python-new" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/python-new</a>. 

+ You can use a variable to store a __list__ of players. The list should be in square brackets `[ ]`, with a comma between each item in the list. 

	Start by adding a list of players to your program.

+ Add this code to print your `players` variable:

+ You can get to an item in the list by adding its position in square brackets after the variable name.

	The first item in the list is at __position 0__. This is different to Scratch, which starts at position 1.
