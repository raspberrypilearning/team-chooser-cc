## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make a program to split a list of players into 2 random teams. This project teaches lists and using files.

## Online Resources

__This project uses Python 3.__ We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ [New (blank) Python Trinket -- jumpto.cc/python-new](http://jumpto.cc/python-new)

There is also a trinket containing the completed project:

+ [‘Team Chooser’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/a699c44ce6](https://trinket.io/python/a699c44ce6)

## Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ team/team.py

You can also find a completed version of this project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ team-finished/team.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives
+ Lists;
+ Loading list data from a file.
+ Understand the skills which are developed towards a career involving Computing

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges
+ "Adding more players" - adding elements to a `players` list;
+ "Choosing for team B" - creating a new `teamB` list to add random players to;
+ "Random team names" - creating and using a new `teamNames` list to assign random names to teams;
+ "Storing team names" - storing team names in a file, and loading them into a `teamNames` variable;
+ "More teams" - splitting players into 3 teams instead of 2.
