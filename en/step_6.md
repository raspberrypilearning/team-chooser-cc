## Choosing lots of players

Next you'll need to make sure that every player has been chosen for a team.



+ Highlight your code for choosing players for team A and team B and press the tab key to indent the code.

+ Add a __while__ loop to keep choosing players until the length of the `players` list is 0.

+ Run your code to test it. You should see players being chosen for team A and team B until there are no more players left.

+ Add code to print your `teamA` list __after__ your `while` loop (making sure it is not indented).

	This means that `teamA` will only be printed once, after all the players have been chosen.

+ You can do the same for `teamB`, and you can also delete the other print commands, as they were only there to test your code.

	Here's how your code should look:

+ Test your code again and you should just see your list of players as well as your final teams.
